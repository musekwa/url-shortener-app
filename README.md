# url-shortener-app

This is one of a set of microservice projects I developed so far. I used Node.js, Express.js, EJS, MongoDB+Mongoose to build an url shortener. It works as follows:
The user enter an url of any website;
Then, the application returns the provided url and its correspondent shortened url.
The application returns unique shortened url to each url.
